## Want to use AvaIre but don't want to host it yourself?

No problem, we maintain a public instance of AvaIre that you can invite to your server!<br>Visit https://avairebot.com/invite to get started!

## Want more control and run AvaIre yourself?

There are a lot of advantages of self-hosting AvaIre, like removing playlists and aliases limits, stream music from your own computer with no worry about anyone else using bandwidth for streaming music, create custom commands or language files to change how Ava responds to commands, et cetera.

You can find self-hosting guides for [Windows](https://avairebot.com/docs/windows-guide), and [Linux](https://avairebot.com/docs/linux-guide) systems that should help you get started. If you'd like to contribute to Ava and are a bit confused about the framework, you can also find the [Developers Handbook](https://avairebot.com/docs/contributions) in the documentation.

If you are not into hosting the bot yourself, you can always invite AvaIre to your server [from here](https://avairebot.com/invite).
